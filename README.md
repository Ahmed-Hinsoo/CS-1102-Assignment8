Java Program - Employee Data Processor

In this assignment, you will assess your skills and knowledge to describe the purpose, characteristics, and usage of the function interface; and explain the concept of streams.

Context: You are working on a project that involves processing a large dataset using Java. You need to utilize the Function interface and streams to efficiently manipulate the data and produce specific outputs. To ensure that your team has a thorough understanding of these concepts, you decide to create a challenging programming question that tests their knowledge and problem-solving skills.

For this assignment, consider a scenario where you have a dataset containing a list of employees in a company. Each employee object has attributes such as name, age, department, and salary. 

For this assignment design a Java program that uses the Function interface and streams to perform the following operations:


Develop a program that reads the dataset and stores it in a collection.
Write a function using the Function interface that takes an employee object as input and returns the employee's name and department as a concatenated string.
Using streams, generate a new collection that contains the concatenated strings obtained from the previous step.
Enhance your program to find the average salary of all employees using the stream's built-in functions.
Generalize your program by incorporating a filter function that only includes employees whose age is above a certain threshold (e.g., 30 years).
Summarize the program by explaining the purpose, characteristics, and usage of the Function interface in Java, highlighting how it represents a function that takes an input and produces an output.
Compose a complete Java program that implements the given scenario, demonstrating your understanding of the Function interface, streams, and their practical applications in data manipulation.
You will be accessed based on the following criteria:


Program Structure and Correctness: The program correctly reads and stores the dataset, uses the Function interface to concatenate employee names and departments, utilizes streams to generate a new collection, calculates the average salary, and incorporates a filter function based on age threshold, producing accurate results for all operations.
Proper Usage of Function Interface and Streams: The program demonstrates a clear understanding of the Function interface by correctly implementing it to transform employee objects into concatenated strings, and effectively utilizes streams to process the dataset, perform operations, and chain multiple stream operations.
Efficiency and Performance: The program efficiently utilizes streams to process the dataset, minimizes memory usage and processing time, and takes advantage of stream's lazy evaluation and short-circuiting behavior to optimize performance.
Code Readability and Documentation: The code is well-structured, properly indented, uses meaningful variable and method names, includes comments to explain important sections, and provides a clear and concise explanation of the purpose and usage of the code components.
Additional Features: The program includes bonus functionalities or improvements that go beyond the specified requirements, showcasing creativity and innovation in enhancing the functionality or performance of the employee management system.
